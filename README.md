# Operation-Metric-Analysis(Insights Analysis using MySQL)
## Project Objective:
To analyze key operational metrics and user behavior data to identify performance trends, detect anomalies, and generate actionable insights that support optimization of system throughput, user engagement, and retention.

# KPIs
##  Job Data Analysis
- Calculate the number of jobs reviewed per hour for each day in November 2020
- Calculate the 7-day rolling average of throughput (number of events per second)
- Calculate the percentage share of each language in the last 30 days
- Identify duplicate rows in the data

##  Investigating Metric Spike
- Measure the activeness of users on a weekly basis
- Analyze the growth of users over time for a product( calculate the user growth for the product)
- calculate the weekly retention of users based on their sign-up cohort
- calculate the weekly engagement per device
- how users are engaging with the email service( calculate the email engagement metrics)

# Process
- Extracted operational and user data using advanced SQL queries
- Cleaned and validated data for consistency across time and metrics
- Segmented data by week, device, language, and user type
- Calculated key performance indicators (KPIs) like throughput, retention, and CTR
- Analyzed trends, anomalies, and performance shifts across metrics
- Interpreted findings to deliver actionable insights for business decisions

# Project Insights
- Job review volume increased steadily, with a few spikes indicating potential backlog or demand surges
- Reviewer throughput varied, highlighting differences in efficiency
- Certain languages dominated the job volume, suggesting regional or content focus
- User retention dropped slightly week-over-week, indicating a need for re-engagement strategies
- Mobile engagement was consistently higher, showing a user preference for mobile platforms
- Email click-through rates were low, suggesting poor engagement with email campaigns

# Final Conclusion
The analysis revealed operational strengths and gaps in user retention and communication. Improving reviewer efficiency, enhancing mobile experience, and optimizing email strategies can significantly boost overall performance.
